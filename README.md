# CKB Sentences Corpus for TTS and ASR

## Overview

The CKB Sentences Corpus is a comprehensive dataset designed for various natural language processing (NLP) applications, specifically focusing on Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. This dataset contains 1000 sentences in Central Kurdish (CKB), covering a wide range of topics. The corpus is structured to provide diverse linguistic content, making it an invaluable resource for training and evaluating TTS and ASR models.

## Corpus Details

The corpus includes sentences from the following topics, each contributing a specific number of sentences:

## Usage

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

The corpus can be used to train TTS systems by providing diverse and phonetically rich sentences. It covers a wide range of topics, ensuring that the generated speech can handle various vocabulary and sentence structures. This diversity helps in creating a more natural and intelligible synthetic voice for CKB.

### Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

For ASR, this corpus serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating models. The sentences include a wide range of phonetic and syntactic structures, which are essential for developing robust ASR systems capable of understanding different accents and speaking styles in CKB.

### Other Applications

In addition to TTS and ASR, the CKB Sentences Corpus can be utilized for:

- **Language Modeling:** Developing models that can predict the next word or sentence in a sequence.
- **Speech Translation:** Training models to translate spoken CKB into other languages.
- **Voice Conversion:** Converting one speaker's voice to another within the CKB language.
- **Speech Synthesis Research:** Analyzing and improving the quality of synthetic speech.
